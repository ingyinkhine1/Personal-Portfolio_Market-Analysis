Cleaning data process

Using MySQL, creating inserting each value, creating table and joining each table to develop usable data. As I mentioned above, I have some restriction to connect with PowerBI so I also used to clean excel file using some formula like concat, vlookup, pivot, etc.

Using bar chart, table, line chart, card, KPI card, gauge, and map visual to demonstrate clearly for the data required by stakeholders. Using drill through, page navigation function to access easily and get insights right away.
